# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rebecca

You probably wouldn't guess but I am Brazilian (!), from SÃ£o Paulo, and I have moved to Lisbon in 2017.

I am currently working as a Technical Writer but I also really enjoy coding and learning about new tech and collaboration platforms.

## :rocket: So far...

Back in my hometown I have graduated in Linguistics and here in Portugal I took a Post-Graduate course in Digital Communication.

In 2019, and after I got my first job in tech working as a support agent for Pipedrive, I started to get increasingly interested in web and software development and ever since I have been attending workshops, presentations and basicaly using all the time I can to learn more and work on side projects.

## :round_pushpin: What now?

I am currently working at SISCOG, a software house focussed on decision support applications.

Besides keeping up with what I have learned already - HTML, CSS, JS, React -, I am also on the watch out for developments in Data Science and naturally focussing on cultivating my user documentation skills :seedling:. 

## :speech_balloon: Let's get in touch!

If you're interested, please feel free to check my repos, respective websites and Trello boards and let me know what you think.

Also, if you have any projects where some help with the docs could come in handy, do not hesitate to reach out!
