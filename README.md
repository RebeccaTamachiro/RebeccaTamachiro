# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rebecca 

You probably wouldn't guess but I am Brazilian, from SÃ£o Paulo, and I have moved to Lisbon in 2017.

I currently work as a **Technical Writer** at **Cloudflare** but I also really enjoy coding and learning about new tech.

## :rocket: So far...

Back in my hometown I have graduated in Linguistics and in Portugal I took a Post-Graduate course in Digital Communication.

In 2019, and after I got my first job in tech - working as a support agent for **Pipedrive** -, I became increasingly interested in web and software development.

From May 2021 to August 2022, I have worked as a Technical Writer at SISCOG, developing and maintaining user documentation about their decision support applications.

## :round_pushpin: What now?

I am currently focussed on improving my Technical Communication skills and maintaing familiriaty with stack I have already been introduced to - HTML, CSS, JS, React.

Having had contact with some development processes, I enjoy following a **Docs-as-Code** approach and I also like the **DiÃ¡taxis framework** for content structuring in user documentation.
